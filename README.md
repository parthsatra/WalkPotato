# Problem Description
We have a lot of fitness apps that purely do bookkeeping, but doesn't motivate people to achieve their fitness goals on a regular basis. This app aims at providing the missing motivation with the help of positive as well negative reinforcements. The key idea is to help people manage their time better and give them enough incentives to exercise and stay fit. 

# How the App Works

The app uses the existing Google fit API's to keep the record of the steps and on top of that adds additional features like Blocking of entertainment Apps on the phone which user spends most his time on, so that the user can spend some time staying fit and also providing rewards to the users who consistently achieve their goals and help them stay motivated. 

# Future Work 

We would like to add features like social media integration to add a competitive aspect to the app and thus keep people hooked on to the app for a longer duration. Along with the basic functionality also provide smart methods of suggesting which apps to block and setting up a weekly schedule depending the BMI index of the person and thus helping the user stay fit.
